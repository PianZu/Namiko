## Note from the developer

I used this project to teach myself programming as I was studying in my computer science course. Even though it was refactored a few times, it might still be difficult to understand and set-up for anyone who is not me.

I have tried many patterns and C# features while developing this, which you can explore in the codebase. Some of the features are implemented in clever but difficult patterns, such as a method that takes any list of items and turns it into a fully interactive paginated embed on Discord. Some features are implemented in dumb patterns, such as using static methods for almost everything that should be a service. 

Alas, the end product is performant and of high quality, but difficult to maintain and demands some major refactoring, such as introducing proper dependency injection.

The last major effort in the codebase was the conversion to Discord slash command support. Now all the modules work both as text commands and slash commands with the same implementation ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘ŒðŸ’¯
